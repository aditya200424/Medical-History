Healthcare Innovation Platform

A unified, secure, ABDM-compliant digital health platform that stores patient records in encrypted cloud lockers, enables role-based access for doctors, labs, and pharmacies, and eliminates paper-based errors and prescription forgery. Patients fully control consent while providers access exactly what they need — no more, no less.

🚨 Problem Statement

Healthcare data in India is fragmented across hospitals, labs, and pharmacies. This leads to:

Paper-based errors and lost records

Forgery and privacy risks

No shared digital locker for records

Slow treatment due to missing history

Lack of interoperability between systems

There is no mandatory encrypted digital system that connects all stakeholders securely and complies with ABDM standards.

->Target Users

Patients: View health history & control consent

Doctors: Access complete medical records

Labs/Hospitals: Upload verified reports

Pharmacies: Validate prescriptions only

Government: Enable nationwide adoption via ABHA/NDHM

Core Solution

A national digital health locker with:

🔐 AES-256 encrypted records

🔗 Blockchain-based audit logs

👥 Role-based access control

📲 Mandatory digital prescriptions (QR / Token)

🏛 ABDM/NDHM API integration

Patients approve or deny access — and every access is traceable.

-> Key Features

Patient dashboard with complete history

Doctor portal with reports, tests & treatment insights

Secure lab uploads linked to ABHA ID

Pharmacy prescription validation (no extra access)

Consent-driven sharing

Tamper-proof logs via blockchain

Notifications & digital prescriptions

🏗️ Architecture & Tech Stack

Frontend: React / Flutter (Web + Mobile)
Backend: Node.js or Django REST API
Database: Encrypted PostgreSQL + IPFS (distributed storage)
Auth: Aadhaar / ABHA + OAuth 2.0
Security: AES-256, SSL, End-to-End Encryption, Blockchain logs
Cloud: AWS / Azure / NIC
APIs: ABDM / NDHM interoperability

->Architecture Flow 
ABHA Login → Role-Based Access → Secure Uploads/Validation
→ Encrypted Storage → Consent Management → Notifications

🛡️ Security First

End-to-end encryption

Token-based secure access

Immutable audit trail

Role-restricted visibility

GDPR- & HIPAA-like alignment
